#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

Software engineering refers to the use of engineering techniques in the creation, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.

Importances
- It enables creation of Complex Systems by offering structured methodologies essential for developing sophisticated systems example healthcare applications and telecommunications platforms, which are essential to modern technology.
- Enables Software Reliability and Optimal Performance: Through comprehensive testing, validation, and optimization, software engineering guarantees that applications function reliably and efficiently across diverse conditions, reducing downtime and boosting user confidence.
- Lowering Development Expenses by Optimizing Processes: By leveraging efficient design strategies, reusable code components, and continuous integration practices, software engineering reduces the resources required for both initial development and ongoing maintenance, resulting in substantial cost savings.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
- Advent of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s) -Replaced unstructured code with organized programming techniques, enhancing code clarity and maintainability.
- Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s) - cIntroduced principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, promoting reusable and modular code structures.
- Introduction of the Agile Manifesto (2001)c- Shifted focus to adaptive, iterative development that prioritizes teamwork, customer feedback, and flexibility.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning -
  Setting clear objectives, defining the project scope, and evaluating practicality to ensure successful execution.

- Collecting and Documenting Requirements - Gathering essential functional features and performance-related expectations to guide the development process.

- Design - Designing the softwareâ€™s structure and technical specifications to outline how it will function.

- Implementation - Writing and integrating code to transform design documents into a working application.

- Testing - To ensure it operates correctly and meets intended requirements by detecting and fixing issues.

- Deployment - Releasing the software into production environments, making it available for users.

- Maintenance - Continuously enhancing the software by resolving issues, adding improvements, and ensuring long-term effectiveness.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

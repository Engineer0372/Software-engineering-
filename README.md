#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

 Software engineering applies engineering principles to the creation, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It’s essential in the technology industry because:

 - Building Complex Systems: It provides structured methods for developing complicated systems like healthcare applications and telecommunications platforms, which are vital in today’s world.

- Ensuring Software Reliability: With proper testing, validation, and optimization, software performs reliably, reducing downtime and enhancing user trust.

- Reducing Costs: Efficient design, reusable code, and continuous integration save resources during both development and maintenance, lowering overall costs.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
- Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): Introduced organized coding techniques, improving code clarity and ease of maintenance.
- Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Brought concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code reusable and modular.
- Agile Manifesto (2001): Shifted focus to adaptive development, emphasizing teamwork, customer feedback, and flexibility.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 - Planning: Define goals, scope, and feasibility for smooth execution.
 - Requirements Gathering: Identify functional and non-functional needs to shape development.
 - Design: Plan the software's structure and technical specifications.
 - Implementation: Write and integrate code based on the design
 - Testing: Check the software’s functionality and fix issues.
 - Deployment: Release the product to users.
 - Maintenance: Update and improve the software continuously.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 - Waterfall Model: Involves a sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next.Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, e.g., Library Management System.

- Agile Methodology:Flexible, iterative approach with continuous feedback and improvement.Best for projects that need frequent updates, e.g., Food Delivery Mobile App.

- Key Differences:
  -- Customer Involvement: Agile involves customers throughout, while Waterfall engages them mainly at the start and end.
Development Approach: Agile uses incremental development; Waterfall follows a linear path.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 - Software Developer
   - Writes and maintains code, collaborates with stakeholders, and fixes bugs.
- Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
  - Designs test plans, identifies bugs, and ensures the product meets requirements.
- Project Manager 
  -  Coordinates tasks, manages risks, and keeps stakeholders updated.
 
6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
    - Boost productivity with features like auto-completion and real-time error detection (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS):
    - Track code changes, manage versions, and support collaboration (e.g., Git, GitHub).

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-  Complex Codebases:Write clear, consistent code and use proper documentation.
- Debugging Issues: Use IDE debugging tools and implement robust logging systems to trace problems efficiently.
  
8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   - Unit Testing: Verifies individual functions. Detects early bugs, saving time and costs.
   - Integration Testing: Checks module interactions. Prevents system failures by addressing integration issues early. 
   - System Testing: Evaluates performance and requirement compliance. Ensures the product meets business goals.
   - Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  -  Prompt engineering means crafting clear, precise instructions to interact with AI models. It’s crucial because:
      - It guides AI to generate relevant, useful outputs.
      - It enhances AI performance and tailors responses to user needs.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   - Example of a vague prompt - Discuss technology

Improved prompt
   - "Write a 250-word essay on how smartphones have changed modern communication. Discuss both advantages, like instant connectivity, and disadvantages, such as less face-to-face interaction."

 - Importance
  - Clear Focus: Targets smartphones in communication.
  - Specific Content: Requires discussion of pros and cons.
  - Structured Response: Specifies length and content, making the answer organized and relevant.

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

 Software engineering refers to the use of engineering techniques in the creation, development, testing, and 
 maintenance of software systems.

 Importances
 - It enables creation of Complex Systems by offering structured methodologies essential for developing sophisticated 
 systems example healthcare applications and telecommunications platforms, which are essential to modern technology.
 - Enables Software Reliability and Optimal Performance: Through comprehensive testing, validation, and optimization, 
 software engineering guarantees that applications function reliably and efficiently across diverse conditions, 
 reducing downtime and boosting user confidence.
 - Lowering Development Expenses by Optimizing Processes: By leveraging efficient design strategies, reusable code 
 components, and continuous integration practices, software engineering reduces the resources required for both 
 initial development and ongoing maintenance, resulting in substantial cost savings.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
 - Advent of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s) -Replaced unstructured code with organized programming techniques, 
 enhancing code clarity and maintainability.
 - Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s) - cIntroduced principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, 
 and polymorphism, promoting reusable and modular code structures.
 - Introduction of the Agile Manifesto (2001)c- Shifted focus to adaptive, iterative development that prioritizes 
 teamwork, customer feedback, and flexibility.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 - Planning -
   Setting clear objectives, defining the project scope, and evaluating practicality to ensure successful execution.
 - Collecting and Documenting Requirements - Gathering essential functional features and performance-related 
  expectations to guide the development process.
 - Design - Designing the software’s structure and technical specifications to outline how it will function.
 - Implementation - Writing and integrating code to transform design documents into a working application.
 - Testing - To ensure it operates correctly and meets intended requirements by detecting and fixing issues.
 - Deployment - Releasing the software into production environments, making it available for users.
 - Maintenance - Continuously enhancing the software by resolving issues, adding improvements, and ensuring long-term 
 effectiveness.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 - Waterfall model is a step-by-step method for developing software, where each stage flows into the next, similar to 
 a waterfall. The process starts with gathering requirements, followed by designing the system, writing the code, 
 testing the software, deploying it, and finally maintaining it. Every phase needs to be finished before moving 
 forward, leaving little room for changes along the way. This makes the model easy to follow and manage, especially 
 for projects with clear, unchanging requirements. However, its rigid structure means it’s not ideal for projects 
 where flexibility and revisions are needed later in the process.
 Example - Library Management System

 - Agile methodology is an approach to software development that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and delivering 
 work in small, manageable sections called iterations or sprints. Instead of trying to plan everything from the start, 
 Agile teams adapt to changes as the project progresses. This means that feedback is gathered frequently, and 
 adjustments are made based on evolving needs.
  Example  - Food delivery mobile app software

 Differences between Agile and Waterfall methodologies.
 - In agile methodology the customers are involved thoughout the project, by giving feedback as the software is being 
 developed whereas in Waterfall methodology the cunsumer get involved during the gathering of the system requirements 
 and during delivery of the final product.
 - In agile methodology  a project is developed in small incremental cycles allowing continous consumer inputs 
 rgarding the product whereas in waterfall methodology the project follows a sequential process where one phase must 
 be completed before moving to the next phase.



5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

 - Software Developer 
    - Writing, testing and maintaining code to build software applications.
    - Collorating with stakeholders to meet the project requirements.
    - Fixing bugs and making updates to ensure smooth software performance.
 - Qualify Assurance Officer
    - Ensure the software meets both functional and non-functional requirements
    - dentifying bugs and issues, then working with developers to resolve them
    - Designing and executing test plans to ensure software quality
 - Project Manager
    - Communicating with stakeholders to keep them updated on progress.
    - Managing risks and addressing issues that could affect project success
    - Coordinating tasks between team members and ensuring deadlines are met
 
   

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 - Boosts Productivity: Features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and real-time error detection help developers code faster and with fewer mistakes.
- Simplifies Debugging: Built-in debugging tools make it easier to detect and resolve issues quickly.
-Organizes Projects: IDEs help manage files and code structures, which is especially useful for large projects

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
